    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            PREPARATION: Cut the leeks into thin strips and wash them
            thoroughly to remove any dirt. Peel and dice the potatoes and 
            carrots into bite-sized pieces. Cut the salmon into large cubes. 
            Chop the dill finely.
        </li>
        <li>
            SAUTÉ: In a large pot or saucepan, melt the butter over 
            medium heat and sauté the leeks and carrots until they start 
            to soften.
        </li>
        <li>
            COOK: Once the leeks and carrots have reduced in volume by 
            about half, add the potatoes and fish stock. Season with salt 
            and black pepper. Simmer for 15 minutes at medium heat until 
            the potatoes are cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
            SALMON: Add the salmon cubes and cream. Cook over medium 
            heat for 3-5 minutes until the salmon is cooked. The cream 
            should not boil. Close the lid and wait for another five 
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            SERVE: To finish, add the fresh dill. Serve in a bowl with 
            more dill, black pepper, and lemon to taste.
