        <li>Beef Broth</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            PREPARATION: Slice the beef into thin strips against the grain.
            Clean and slice the mushrooms. Finely chop the onions and garlic.
        </li>
        <li>
            SÉAR: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat.
            Add the beef strips in batches to avoid overcrowding. Sear until
            browned on all sides but not fully cooked. Remove and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            SAUTÉ: In the same skillet, add butter and sauté the onions until
            translucent. Add the garlic and mushrooms, cooking until the
            mushrooms release their moisture and start to brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            MAKE SAUCE: Sprinkle flour over the mushroom mixture and stir well
            to coat. Gradually add beef broth while stirring to avoid lumps.
            Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens.
        </li>
        <li>
            COMBINE: Return the seared beef to the skillet. Stir in sour cream
            and Dijon mustard. Cook for a few more minutes until the beef is
            cooked through but still tender. Do not boil.
        </li>
        <li>
            SERVE: Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot over egg noodles,
            rice, or mashed potatoes.
        </li>
