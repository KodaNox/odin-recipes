This is so barebones looking that I can't wait to get into CSS to style 
it and make it look better. A few things I learned during 
this project: 

1. Use paragraph tags instead of line break tags for spacing.

2. Use width=50% instead of setting the pixels manually to have 
the browser resize according to the image's aspect ratio.

3. Use ctrl + [ and ] to shift blocks of code all at once when highlighted 
instead of line-by-line.
